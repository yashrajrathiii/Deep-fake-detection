Deepfake technology, which involves creating realistic and deceptive synthetic media, has gained significant attention due to its potential to manipulate and spread false information. Particularly concerning is the emergence of deepfake faces, where individuals' faces can be convincingly replaced or altered in videos. The detection and prevention of such deepfake faces have become critical to combat the spread of misinformation and protect individuals' privacy. This abstract presents an overview of deepfake face detection techniques and advancements in recent years. Initially, the focus was on detecting facial morphing or inconsistencies, leveraging techniques such as image tampering detection and digital forensics. However, with the rapid evolution of deepfake technology, more sophisticated deep-learning approaches have been developed. These involve training deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on large datasets comprising real and deep fake faces, enabling the network to learn discriminative features for accurate detection. Several deepfake detection datasets, such as FaceForensics++, have been introduced to aid research in this area. Moreover, the combination of techniques, including facial landmarks analysis, image quality assessment, and temporal consistency analysis, has proven valuable in improving the detection performance. While progress has been made in deepfake detection methods, challenges remain in dealing with increasing levels of sophistication in deepfake generation techniques. Additional research is required to develop robust and efficient detection methods to counter the evolving deepfake threat.
